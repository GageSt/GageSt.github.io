        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Prior to working towards my <em>Associate Degree in Software Development</em> I’d had an interest in technology. Working <strong>four years </strong>at <b>Simply LED’s</b> and spending time programming drivers for commercial warehouse lights has encouraged me to work more intimately with programming and software. During my time at the company I also had the opportunity to see the operations, struggles, and product-goals involving the implementation of networking software.</p>
