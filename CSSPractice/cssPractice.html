     <p>LANGLEY, VA&mdash;A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
     <p>According to the report, sections of the documents&mdash; "almost invariably the most crucial passages"&mdash;are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p> 
     <p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>the Cold War</li>
      <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
       <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
     </ul>
